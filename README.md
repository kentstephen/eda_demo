# This Notebook is a Demonstration of Exploratory Data Analysis on Social Security Name Data

## Using Data From BigQuery, with DuckDB and Pandas

[gcs_con.py](https://github.com/kentstephen/eda_demo/blob/main/gcs_con.py) is where I pull the data from Big Query and load the data into a persisted DuckDB.

And [eda_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/kentstephen/eda_demo/blob/main/demo_eda.ipynb) is the Jupyter Notebook where I conduct the analysis on the SSA data.
